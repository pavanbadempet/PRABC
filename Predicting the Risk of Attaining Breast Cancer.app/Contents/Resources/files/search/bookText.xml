           woman is diagnosed with breast cancer

           every four minutes. Breast cancer is
           becoming more prevalent in both rural

          Predicting the Risk of Breast Cancer is a tool for estimating the

          prospect of developing carcinoma . Using this tool, a user can enter some
          information including age, weight, height, history of carcinoma in 1st

          degree relative, age of a user at the primary birth or nulliparity,

          menopausal status, history of previous breast biopsy, and history of using
          hormone replacement therapy. Then, the app will return the prospect of

          developing Cancer . Upon returning of the result, the tool also provides

          additional insights about carcinoma from the dataset.]]></page><page Index="40"><![CDATA[Database Approach to
